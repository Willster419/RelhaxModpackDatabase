I would like to preface this by stating this tank skins update was started over 10 days ago. The team as a whole (myself included) put in about 30 hours for this update. We had to:

 - Check for mod updates
 - Convert them to wotmod, if not done already
 - Log changes for future reference
 - Individually test each mod by hand in a replay to check that it works (there's over 50 of these)

Big shout-out to the team for making this happen :)
